Tigertronics has moved from Union Endicott High School to Vestal High School, just 10 minutes away from the old location! Nothing about the core values of the team have changed, but we are changing our name and brand
to reflect the multi-school participation of the club.

## Changes

- We need to make some changes to reflect the new team and brand. From here on out, we are now known as Southern Tier Robotics (STR). The simple team name and logo allow us more freedom with our branding and designs.
- We will now be meeting in the Vestal High School Wood Shop.
- Students from Vestal and Union Endicott are still allowed to participate.

We are sure that these changes are a positive one and are looking forward to meeting at Vestal this fall. We'd like to thank Vestal Schools for making this possible.

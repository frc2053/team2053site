  title: What is Southern Tier Robotics?
  description: >
    Southern Tier Robotics is a member of the FIRST Organization that competes in the FIRST Robotics competition.
    Each year we build a 120 pound robot to compete in a game at events across the US.

  Our organization is focused on four core areas: Engineering, Learning, Community, and Competition.

        Engineering: Each year we push our robots to a higher level by using advanced
        software, machining and design techniques using equipment we have in our shop.
        With access to CNC Mills, Lathes, and other machines, this allows us to design
        the most optimized parts for our robot easily.

        Learning: Our club is run by mentors from local engineering companies, as well
        as teachers, and other adults. This allows students to get REAL, PRACTICAL, knowledge
        about engineering tools. A lot of our students have been inspired about what they want
        to do after highschool from our organization.

        Community: One of the goals of all FIRST teams is to spread the message of FIRST 
        and promote STEAM throughout the community. We do outreach events such as visiting
        local elementary and middle schools, doing fundraisers, and STEAM events.

        Competition: A huge part of the FIRST organization is competition. We strive to 
        build a better robot than we did last year and win the events we go to. We have consistently
        placed in the playoff brackets every year we have competed.
  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
